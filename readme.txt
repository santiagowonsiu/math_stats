This Readme file details a multi-faceted project utilizing four Jupyter notebooks to analyze various datasets, including housing prices, mobile usage effects on object detection, music data classification, and wine characteristics. The project aims to apply advanced mathematical and statistical methods to glean significant insights from these data sets.For mobile usage analysis sought to understand the influence of mobile habits on visual search efficiency, considering demographics. This section highlighted data preprocessing and the establishment of relational patterns via visualization tools.The housing data, linear regression models were built to predict housing prices, ensuring that the assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of errors were met. The primary challenge was integrating numeric and categorical data.The music dataset underwent quantitative analysis for classification purposes, utilizing support vector machines and random forests, while focusing on feature scaling and the application of machine learning techniques.Wine data was explored through linear regression to predict 'proline' content, with a focus on model evaluation and the relationship between features.The project consistently emphasized data quality through rigorous preprocessing and cleaning. Model selection was thoughtful, catering to the specifics of each dataset.Additional references enhance the project's foundation, including "Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis" by Montgomery et al., and resources like Khan Academy for statistics. Relevant journals like the "Journal of the Royal Statistical Society" provide contextual support. Main libraries leveraged for this project were: pandas, statsmodels, sklearn numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. References from their main sites were used to guide analysis logic.These references serve to underpin the methodologies and findings with robust theoretical and empirical support, ensuring a well-rounded and academically sound project.
